## Data Science coding examples using Python & R


[Project 1, A simple linear regression model.](https://github.com/BryanMcGuire-DataScience/simple_linear_regression)

**This is a simple example of usinging linear regression on some salary data.**

- Data set attached is around 40 data points for the sake of brevity.


[Project 2, multi linear regression model.](https://github.com/BryanMcGuire-DataScience/simple_linear_regression)

**This is an simple example of usinging multiple linear regression on some salary data.**

- Data set is around 100 data points for the sake of brevity



[Project 3, polynominal regression model.](https://github.com/BryanMcGuire-DataScience/polynominal_regression)

**This is an example of usinging polynomial linear regression on some salary data.**


[Project 4, Analysing Sales Data.](https://github.com/BryanMcGuire-DataScience/Sales_example)

**This is an example of analysing sales data.**
- Explores sales data and answers 3 questions
- What are the best products?
- When is the best time to advistise products?
- What cities sell the most popular products?
